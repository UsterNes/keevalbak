Description: 
        Python scripts for full and incremental backups to an S3 bucket
        
        "keevalbak" stands for "Key-Value-Backup". keevalbak backs up
        a directory on a file system to a key-value store, where keys
        are unicode strings, and values are byte arrays. An implementation
        of a such a key-value store on Amazon S3 is included. (The limitations
        of S3 for key-lengths and value sizes apply therefore to the backups.)
        
        Each file is matched to a corresponding key-value pair.
        Additional key-value pairs provide meta-data about 
            * backups with dates and whether they are full or incremental
            * directories (including empty directories)
            * which file contents are written to and which file contents
              reference other contents previously written.
            * major version of keevalbak used to create each backup
        
        Incremental backups are supported on the basis that files whose
        exact contents have already been written (since the last full back up)
        can reference those previously written contents.
        
        Version 2 is not backwards compatible with version 1.
        After upgrading to version 2, new full backups must be performed for
        all backups. To restore old version 1 backups, use version 1 of the 
        software.
